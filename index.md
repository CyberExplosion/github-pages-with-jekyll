      So today is Saturday of the 2nd week I been into my Winter session Physics
      class, however, things are still quite bad I feel. I can't still keep up
      with the horrendous wake up schedule. Still the class itself to me is quite
      worth while to do so, since I was doing quite bad in Physics back in highschool maybe this is a good thing just that it's still hard to cope with the reality. At least during the weekend I can study more stuffs about computers and such, right now I'm doing this course on GitHub and it seems to be quite intersting so far. Will update this post daily (if I like doing so lol, never get much into the idea of writting blog or diary ever b4) :peace: :hand_up:
